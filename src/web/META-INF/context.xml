    Context configuration for MELANBIDE11 module
    
    This configuration optimizes JSP compilation by configuring which JARs
    Tomcat should scan for Tag Library Descriptors (TLDs).
    
    The jarsToSkip pattern excludes most JARs from TLD scanning, except those
    that are known to contain tag libraries (jstl, standard, taglibs-*).
    
    This significantly improves application startup time and JSP compilation
    performance when dealing with a large number of JAR files (400+ in this case).

    <JarScanner>
        <!-- 
            Skip most JARs during TLD scanning to improve performance.
            Only scan JARs that are known to contain tag libraries.
            
            Pattern explanation:
            - We skip all JARs by default (*.jar)
            - Exception: jstl*.jar, standard*.jar, taglibs*.jar are NOT skipped
              (these contain actual TLD files needed for JSP tag libraries)
